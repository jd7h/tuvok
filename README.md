# tuvok
TV-series episode selector based on IMDB-ratings. 

## Etymology
Named after [Tuvok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuvok), the security officer from Star Trek: Voyager. After all, it is only logical to watch only the highest-rated episodes of classic series.

## Goal
I originally made this script for determining which subset of Star Trek episodes to watch.

## Usage and output
The script takes two inputs: an IMDB-id and a minimum rating. I will work on neat argument parsing in the future.
